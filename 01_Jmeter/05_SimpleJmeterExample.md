Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide for creating a simple JMeter HTTP Request test plan based on your outline. This program will simulate 10 users sending GET requests to the website `devopsworld.co.in` and gather results.

### Step-by-Step JMeter HTTP Request Program

#### 1. Add Test Plan
- Open JMeter.
- In the Test Plan tree, right-click on **Test Plan** and select **Add** > **Threads (Users)** > **Thread Group**.

#### 2. Configure Thread Group

- Select the **Thread Group** you just created.
- Set the following parameters:
  - **Number of Threads (users)**: `10`
  - **Ramp-Up Period (seconds)**: `10`
  - **Loop Count**: `1`
- This configuration means that 10 users will start simultaneously over a 10-second period, each sending the request once.

#### 3. Add Logic Controller
- Right-click on the **Thread Group** and select **Add** > **Logic Controller** > **Simple Controller**.
- The Simple Controller will group the requests but does not change execution behavior.

#### 4. Add Sampler in Simple Controller
- Right-click on the **Simple Controller** and select **Add** > **Sampler** > **HTTP Request**.

#### 5. Configure HTTP Request

- Select the **HTTP Request** sampler you just added.
- Set the following parameters:
  - **Name**: You can name it something descriptive (e.g., "GET Request to DevOps World").
  - **Server Name or IP**: `devopsworld.co.in`
  - **Protocol**: `https`
  - **Method**: `GET`
- Leave other parameters as default for this simple test.

#### 6. Add Listeners
- Right-click on the **Thread Group** (or the Test Plan) and select:
  - **Add** > **Listener** > **View Results Tree**.
  - **Add** > **Listener** > **View Results in Table**.
  - **Add** > **Listener** > **Aggregate Report**.
- These listeners will help you observe the results of the test.

#### 7. Run the Test Plan
- Save your test plan (File > Save).
- Click on the green **Start** button (or use **Ctrl + R**) to run the test.
- Once the test completes, you can view the results in the listeners you added:
  - **View Results Tree**: Check the details of each request, including request/response data.
  - **View Results in Table**: See a summary of all requests and their response times.
  - **Aggregate Report**: Get aggregated metrics like average response time, min/max response time, and throughput.

### Observing Results
- In **View Results Tree**, you can see each request made, the response received, and any potential errors.
- The **Aggregate Report** will give you an overall view of the performance metrics, such as average response time and error percentage.

### Conclusion
This simple test plan demonstrates how to set up an HTTP request to a website using JMeter. You can expand upon this basic structure by adding more complexity, such as different request types, parameterization, or additional logic controllers as needed.
